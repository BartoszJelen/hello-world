ideas, projects in mind


Rider University Social media application:
- an application that automates life in the college
- start app. with game that will lure ppl to use this app
- THE IDEA - post/like or die
* each picture posted increases life in the game
* more posts = more life
* more likes = more life
* no like = less life == die 

Sims REAL 
^ The sims update idea
At the begining of the game, usr takes selfie and gets a character(person - male/female) to play with. 
- If user takes more selfies, program uses ML to transform this patterns in immages ( same as face recognision).
- If user records more videos , use ML the same way
* characters can take appearance of the user, learn new behaviors (user based), mimic the voice
